# Notes of Multithreading

### Thread defination-
Thread is lightweight process which has its own context and stack to preserve the state of it. 

### Thread creation approaches :
1. extending Thread class
2. Implementing the Runnable interface

### methods invoked :
1. run
     run method is the entry point to start the execution of thread.
2. start method
    execution of thread should be initiated with this method. Thread is in ready started but not yet running. It marks thread as in ready state and waits for CPU to be allocated.
